## Mood

<!-- e.g., "Professional but bold", "Dark and dramatic", "Spatial and immersive", "Playful and energetic" -->

## Typography

- Heading font: <!-- e.g., Bricolage Grotesque, Playfair Display -->
- Body font: <!-- e.g., IBM Plex Sans, JetBrains Mono -->
- Weight strategy: <!-- e.g., "300 body / 800 headings" or "400 body / 700 headings" -->
- Size scale: <!-- e.g., "14px body / 20px h3 / 28px h2 / 40px h1" -->

## Color Palette

<!-- Use CSS variable names from globals.css / tailwind.config.ts -->

- Dominant: <!-- e.g., --primary: hsl(220, 80%, 50%) — deep blue -->
- Accent 1: <!-- e.g., --accent: hsl(25, 95%, 55%) — vibrant orange -->
- Accent 2: <!-- e.g., --secondary: hsl(160, 70%, 45%) — emerald -->
- Background treatment: <!-- e.g., "dark gradient from slate-950 to slate-900" or "warm off-white with subtle noise" -->
- Surface treatment: <!-- e.g., "glassmorphism cards" or "elevated white cards with layered shadows" -->

## Motion Strategy

- Primary animation approach: <!-- e.g., "staggered reveals on page load, smooth transitions on interaction" -->
- Key transitions: <!-- e.g., "page transitions with fade + slide, card hover with lift" -->
- Library: <!-- CSS transitions | Framer Motion | both -->

## Surface Treatment

<!-- Which surface style defines this project's card/container rendering -->
<!-- Options: glassmorphism | neumorphism | flat-with-depth | solid | mixed -->

## Visual Signature

<!-- 1-2 elements that make THIS project look different from generic dashboards -->

- Signature element 1: <!-- e.g., "glassmorphism cards with purple glow on dark background" -->
- Signature element 2: <!-- e.g., "color-coded category cards with 3D icon badges" -->

## Preferred Aesthetic Patterns

<!-- Which patterns from the frontend-design skill (Step 4) to use in this project -->
<!-- Options: glassmorphism, glow-accents, depth-layering, color-per-card, tactile-surfaces, spatial-decorators -->
